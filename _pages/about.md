### About Me 

Hello and welcome to my website! I'm Hannah, a PhD student at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, specializing in constraint-based search algorithms for multi-robot task and motion planning. I am currently collaborating with Dr. Nancy M. Amato in the Parasol Lab and MIT Lincoln Laboratory on distributed path planning methods for large multi-robot systems. I aim to graduate with my doctorate by May 2025 and am actively seeking opportunities in industry and government.

In addition to my graduate studies, I am a lead instructor with AI4ALL, a nonprofit organization dedicated to educating underrepresented undergraduate students in artificial intelligence and machine learning. We focus on teaching the fundamentals of ML and AI, empowering students to confidently enter the industry and engage in meaningful conversations. During the school year, I teach the Ignite AI course for AI4ALL.

### Research and Interests

My research centers on developing robust methods for multi-robot coordination using constraint-based search algorithms. My work has been submitted to and published in journals such as Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L), Transactions in Robotics (TRO), and IEEE Journal on Robotics Research (IJRR). I am honored to be a recipient of the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship.

My work has primarily focused on constraint-based search algorithms. These are a class of algorithms that systematically impose constraints to find high-quality solutions. Traditionally, these algorithms assume a centralized coordinator and perfect communication. My research explores the behavior of these algorithms and develops generalizable frameworks from our insights that extend their application to distributed planning. At MIT Lincoln Laboratory, I focus on creating constraint-based search algorithms suited for distributed settings with unreliable communication and no centralized coordinator. My goal is to integrate real-world constraints into these algorithms to develop robust and resilient high-quality plans.

To list them out, my research interests are: 
- Multi-robot coordination
- Distributed algorithms
- Parallel algorithms
- Motion planning
- Task planning 

### Personal Life 

I spent the bulk of my life in Arizona and Colorado and have aspired to study computer science since high school. After graduating high school, I began my undergraduate degree at Colorado School of Mines, where I majored in Computer Science with an emphasis on robotic systems and intelligent systems, and minored in Electrical Engineering with an emphasis on digital systems.

I am currently living in Illinois for graduate school and have been enjoying the vibrant campus community. Over the past two summers, I've had the opportunity to live in Boston, a city I've grown fond of and hope to return to after graduating. Outside of my academic pursuits, I enjoy cooking, baking, lifting, rock climbing, and archery.

Fun Facts About Me
- I received my scuba diving license in 2021, but haven't had the chance to use it yet because Champaign is landlocked.
- I am hypermobile, so most of my joints hyperextend.
- I have lived in six different states.
- I'm fluent in Korean.
- I don't have a middle name due to a mix-up at the hospital where I was born.
